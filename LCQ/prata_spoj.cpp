// IEEE is having its AGM next week and the president wants to serve cheese prata after the meeting. The subcommittee members are asked to go to food connection and get P (P<=1000) pratas packed for the function. The stall has L cooks (L<=50) and each cook has a rank R (1<=R<=8). A cook with a rank R can cook 1 prata in the first R minutes 1 more prata in the next 2R minutes, 1 more prata in 3R minutes and so on (he can only cook a complete prata) (For example if a cook is ranked 2, he will cook one prata in 2 minutes one more prata in the next 4 mins an one more in the next 6 minutes hence in total 12 minutes he cooks 3 pratas in 13 minutes also he can cook only 3 pratas as he does not have enough time for the 4th prata). The webmaster wants to know the minimum time to get the order done. Please write a program to help him out.

// Input
// The first line tells the number of test cases. Each test case consist of 2 lines. In the first line of the test case we have P the number of prata ordered. In the next line the first integer denotes the number of cooks L and L integers follow in the same line each denoting the rank of a cook.

// Output
// Print an integer which tells the number of minutes needed to get the order done.

// Example
// Input:
// 3
// 10
// 4 1 2 3 4
// 8
// 1 1
// 8
// 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

// Output:
// 12
// 36
// 1
